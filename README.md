# spelling_game

My app is call Spelling Trivia. It is a game to improve your spelling knowledge. In the beginning, you click the start button, and it shows the same word in two different versions. If the player clicks the correct one, the next questions pops out. Otherwise, the game is over. If the player gets 10 correct answers, the game is over and the player wins. In the future, I like the game to keep on going until the player picks the wrong answer.
